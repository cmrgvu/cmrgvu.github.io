Financial markets are the backbone of the economy, requiring robust regulatory oversight to ensure stability, transparency, and consumer protection. Beyond just banking regulations, the governance of capital markets, derivatives trading, and financial instruments plays a crucial role in maintaining market integrity. Institutions like the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulate stock exchanges, mutual funds, and corporate governance to promote fair and efficient markets. Additionally, fintech policies, digital payments governance, and other emerging financial markets such as cryptocurrencies are reshaping the financial landscape. Our objective is to contribute to the development of a more robust regulatory environment that promotes financial inclusion, market stability, and sustainable economic growth by analysing risk management tactics, compliance systems, and development of financial instruments.
