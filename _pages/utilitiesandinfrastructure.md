Utilities and infrastructure—such as energy, water, telecommunications, and transportation—are essential for economic development and societal well-being. The regulation of utilities and infrastructure is inherently multidisciplinary, requiring regulators to consider techno-economic, social, and environmental factors while selecting regulatory instruments that, when effectively implemented, foster market evolution and enhance competition among regulated entities. Effective regulation in these sectors thus ensures fair pricing, efficiency, sustainability, and accessibility. Our research intends to explore tariff regulations, public-private partnerships (PPPs), smart city governance, and digital infrastructure policies to enhance service quality and long-term sustainability. Furthermore, CMRG aspires to be a key stakeholder that brings together like-minded experts (individual and institutional) to provide inputs to regulatory practitioners on tackling regulatory challenges given the complexity and sector-specific characteristics of utilities and infrastructure regulation.
