Governments and businesses are increasingly held accountable for sustainability, corporate responsibility, and social equity. Our research will look into ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) compliance, labour rights regulations, and circular economy initiatives. We analyse how laws and policies can drive businesses toward ethical practices, sustainability, and long-term resilience in a changing global landscape.
