Regulations must strike a balance between innovation and security and ethical considerations as sectors are transformed by automation, artificial intelligence, and platform economies. Our research intends to examine data privacy laws, AI governance, digital marketplaces, and cybersecurity regulations to ensure technology serves society responsibly. We focus on creating adaptive regulatory frameworks that encourage innovation while mitigating risks.

In this regard, corporate governance is essential for monitoring technology developments and guaranteeing accountability, openness, and moral decision-making in businesses. With the increasing reliance on digital systems and data-driven operations, governance frameworks must evolve to address risks related to algorithmic bias within organisations, cybersecurity threats, and digital fraud. Our research intends to explore best practices in corporate governance for tech- driven businesses, emphasizing the importance of regulatory compliance, responsible innovation, and sustainable business practices in the digital era.
